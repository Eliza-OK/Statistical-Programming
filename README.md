# Update on 17th, Oct.

The code for assessment2 called "practical2-draft.R". ðŸ˜€

Apart from the French queue problem we fouond in the meeting, I also fix another problem. For example, french_queue <- c(0,0,0,0,0), french_time <- c(1,0,0,0,0). This situationi will effect the expected waiting time. Note that teh commented line 18-24 is left for testing. 

Besides, I also add some new comments on it.
